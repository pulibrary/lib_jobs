SUMMARY:Introduction to ArcGIS Pro
DESCRIPTION:A Geographic Information System (GIS) combines software and 
 digital geographic data to generate maps\, tables\, and interactive 
 analyses of spatial information. Princeton faculty\, students\, and staff 
 use GIS technology to manage resources\, explore spatial relationships\, 
 and visualize change. The class\, intended for those with no previous GIS 
 experience\, describes the technology and includes simple exercises to 
 introduce its capabilities. Students will use ArcGIS Pro installed on the 
 classroomâ€™s Windows computers.\n\nThis event is part of the Geographic 
 Information Systems (GIS) workshop series.

SUMMARY:SPIA 1-Day Introduction to Geographic Information Systems
DESCRIPTION:A Geographic Information System (GIS) combines software and 
 digital geographic data to generate maps\, tables\, and interactive 
 analyses of spatial information. Princeton uses GIS to manage resources\, 
 study spatial relationships\, and visualize change. The training session is 
 for those with no previous GIS experience. Students work with ArcGIS Pro\, 
 GIS software manufactured by the Environmental Systems Research Institute 
 (Esri)\, and QGIS\, a free open-source GIS application\, to learn GIS 
 concepts and explore geospatial data.\n\nAttendance at a one-day training 
 session is a prerequisite for SPI 593n\, GIS for Public Policy. Other SPI 
 students may take the one-day training if they wish\, or may register for 
 other short GIS training sessions available through the Library.

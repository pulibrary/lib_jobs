* See if we can share code with POD: lib_jobs/app/models/alma_pod_records/alma_pod_file_list.rb
* Make the record fixes to constituent records too
  * Constituent records share the 852s, 876s, and other 8xx of the hosts.  So allow them to be passed into the MarcRecord initializer
* Each file should have 20000 or fewer records. Zip the file.
* Open connection to AWS S3
* Transfer the non bound-with files to the S3
* Transfer the bound-with (host and constituents) records to the S3
   * All the constituents for a given host have to be in the same file as the host
* unlink the tempfile
* Close the connection to S3.

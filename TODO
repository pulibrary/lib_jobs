* Make a connection to lib-sftp. Separate the responsibility of the sftp connection in a different class. Reuse it in POD and in submit collection. lib_jobs/app/models/alma_pod_records/alma_pod_file_list.rb
   * See if we can share code with POD

* Unzip the file
   * Create a tempfile file with the namespace added. lib_jobs/app/models/marc_collection.rb
* Make the record fixes
* Make the record fixes to constituent records too
* Each file should have 20000 or fewer records. Zip the file.
* Open connection to AWS S3
* Transfer the non bound-with files to the S3
* Transfer the bound-with (host and constituents) records to the S3
   * All the constituents for a given host have to be in the same file as the host
* unlink the tempfile
* Close the connection to S3.

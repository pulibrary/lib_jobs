* See if we can share code with POD: lib_jobs/app/models/alma_pod_records/alma_pod_file_list.rb
* Compress the file before we send it.
* Open connection to AWS S3
  It uses correct region name
  It gets bucket name from config
  It gets bucket creds from envvars
  It puts the file contents to the bucket: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method
  It puts the file contents with a key that matches the current pattern
* Transfer the non bound-with files to the S3
* Transfer the bound-with (host and constituents) records to the S3
* unlink the tempfile
* Close the connection to S3.

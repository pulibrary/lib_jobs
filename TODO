* See if we can share code with POD: lib_jobs/app/models/alma_pod_records/alma_pod_file_list.rb
* Each file should have 10_000 or fewer records, constituent files should have 1_000 hosts or fewer. Zip the file.
* Open connection to AWS S3
* Transfer the non bound-with files to the S3
* Transfer the bound-with (host and constituents) records to the S3
   * All the constituents for a given host have to be in the same file as the host
* unlink the tempfile
* Close the connection to S3.
* Rename the file to .processed on the SFTP server only after the records are successfully sent to S3 (currently it is being added when it is downloaded)
